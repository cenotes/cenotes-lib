What is this?
-------------

This is a **library** project to support encryption/decryption
of expendable notes

An example of a backend that uses the libraries provided here can be
found at https://cenot.es

What this isnâ€™t
---------------

UI/Frontend/Backend/CLI. This is a **library** project. Frontend and
backend solutions are different projects. The reason for this is to
allow flexibility in frontend / backend choice and to avoid huge bundle
projects.

-  A **frontend** project that communicates with the **backend** can be
   found `here <https://github.com/cenotes/cenotes-reaction>`__

-  A **cli** project that uses these libraries can be found
   `here <https://github.com/cenotes/cenotes-cli>`__

Features
